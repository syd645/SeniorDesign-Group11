## Federated Leanring Physical System Implementation 
Here we have the code and resources required to run the server and client code on a laptop and raspberry pi. 
Below are the required libraries as well as how to run the code on each of the systems. 

# Server 


# Client 
Each client needs the staging.py file as well as a config.txt file. 
These need to be placed together in any directory on the raspberry pi. The config file also needs to be updated to the parameters listed below

CLIENT_ID= (This will be the ID for the client, should be 1, 2, 3...)
SERVER_PORT= (Specifies the port on the server to connect to)
SERVER_IP= (Speifies the IP of the server to connect to )
SERVER_NAME= (Specifies the username for the server)
SERVER_PASS= (Specifies the password for the server)
