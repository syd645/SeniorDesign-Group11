## Federated Leanring Physical System Implementation 
Here we have the code and resources required to run the server and client code on a laptop and raspberry pi. 
Below are the required libraries as well as how to run the code on each of the systems. 

# Server 


# Client 
Each client needs the staging.py file as well as a config.txt file. 
These need to be placed together in "List directory here" on the raspberry pi. The config file also needs to be edited to have a unique client number specifing which number client it is in the system (1, 2, 3..) as well as the proper details for the server.
